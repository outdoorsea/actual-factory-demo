## Software Factory Overview

This tutorial uses the [Gas City](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity) framework to build a complete software factory layer on top of Claude Code. This repo acts as the workspace, or **rig**, that the factory works on. You hand the factory a task, and five agents pass it between themselves until the result lands as a pull request you may review.

The work itself is simply to produce ASCII art for a letter, with a rhyming couplet underneath each. The focus, though, is on understanding how work gets dispatched, who reviews it, and where the quality gates sit.

## Walkthrough

### 1. Install the prerequisites

#### Install

Homebrew runs on both macOS and Linux, and `gascity` declares `bd`, `dolt`, `jq`, `tmux`, and
`flock` as dependencies, so one line covers the whole stack:

```bash
brew install gascity gh git
gh auth login
```

`pgrep` and `lsof` are already present on macOS and on any standard Linux desktop. If you are on
Linux without Homebrew, [the Gas City
README](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity#installation) covers the source build.

#### Check

```bash
gc version && bd version && dolt version && gh auth status
```

### 2. Fork this repo

**This repo is also the rig.** Your factory writes its output back into a checkout of this same repository. You do need somewhere you can push, though:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/factory-demo && cd ~/factory-demo
gh repo fork actual-software/actual-factory-demo --clone
```

### 3. Create the factory

```bash
gc init factory
```

`gc init` is interactive and asks two questions:

- Config template: **minimal** (option `2`)
- Provider: **Claude Code** (option `1`)

That writes `factory/`, holding a `city.toml` and a `pack.toml`.

Now start it:

```bash
cd factory && gc start
```

`gc start` registers the city with the supervisor, installs the background service if this is your first city, and brings up the city's Dolt server along with its agents.

**Check:**

```bash
gc cities       # factory, with its absolute path
gc status       # Controller: supervisor-managed (PID ...)
gc doctor       # ✓ pass, ⚠ warning, ✗ error
```

`gc doctor --fix` clears the routine warnings a fresh city reports. Run `gc doctor` again afterwards and you should be down to passes.

The city and the rig live side by side. At this point your directory should look like this:

```text
cd .. && ls
actual-factory-demo/   # your repo fork, which is also the rig
factory/               # the Gas City factory
```

### 4. Install the pack

A **pack** is how Gas City ships agents, formulas, and config as one installable unit. The one for this demo lives in this repo's `factory/` directory — not to be confused with the `factory/` city you just created alongside it.

First, point `RIG_PATH` at your fork's checkout and **verify it before registering anything**. `RIG_PATH` must be wherever step 2 actually put your clone — `$HOME/factory-demo/actual-factory-demo` if you followed it exactly, somewhere else if you cloned from a different directory. This matters because `gc rig add` does not check that the path is a repo: hand it a wrong path and it silently creates an empty directory, registers it, and nothing fails until `./seed.sh` goes missing in step 5.

```bash
export RIG_PATH="$HOME/factory-demo/actual-factory-demo"   # adjust if your clone lives elsewhere
git -C "$RIG_PATH" rev-parse && test -x "$RIG_PATH/seed.sh" && echo "rig path ok"
```

Do not continue until that prints `rig path ok`.

While you are here, tell `gh` that pull requests belong on **your fork**. `gh repo fork --clone` marks the upstream `actual-software` repo as the default base, so without this the factory's `gh pr create` opens its pull requests against the upstream repo instead of yours:

```bash
cd "$RIG_PATH"
gh repo set-default "$(gh api user -q .login)/actual-factory-demo"
```

Now register the rig and import the pack. These commands must run from inside the **city** directory (the `factory/` you created with `gc init`, not this repo's `factory/` pack directory — same name, different job):

```bash
cd "$HOME/factory-demo/factory"   # adjust if you ran `gc init` somewhere else
gc rig add "$RIG_PATH" --name ascii-art
gc import add --rig ascii-art "$RIG_PATH/factory"
gc restart
```

The rig is named `ascii-art` because that's the work it holds.

The `--rig ascii-art` binds the five agents to the rig, which is what puts them in your fork's checkout when they run. Import without it and the agents come up at city scope, where there's no repo to write to.

**Check:**

```bash
gc import list --rig ascii-art   # factory, with a locked commit
gc formula list --rig ascii-art  # ascii-art, alongside the built-in mol-* formulas
gc status                        # five ascii-art/factory.* agents
gc doctor | grep "rig:ascii-art:git"   # must NOT warn "not a git repository"
```

If that last line warns `not a git repository`, the rig was registered against the wrong path. Fix it before moving on: `gc rig remove ascii-art`, correct `RIG_PATH`, and re-run this step.

### 5. Seed the task queue

The agents read work from **beads**, which is a task queue backed by Dolt. Yours is empty right now. The seed script opens two epics and twenty-six tasks, one per letter.

The script must run from the **rig root** — it calls `gc bd`, which resolves the target beads store from the directory it runs in. If you opened a fresh terminal since step 4, `RIG_PATH` is no longer set, so set it again rather than letting `cd "$RIG_PATH"` silently dump you in `$HOME`:

```bash
export RIG_PATH="$HOME/factory-demo/actual-factory-demo"   # adjust if your clone lives elsewhere
cd "$RIG_PATH"
./seed.sh
```

If this fails with `no such file or directory: ./seed.sh`, the problem is not this step: your rig path never contained the fork's checkout. Go back to the verification at the top of step 4.

The script seeds through `gc bd` rather than bare `bd` on purpose: `gc bd` writes to the rig's store, which is the one `gc sling` and the agents read. Bare `bd create` can route beads into a personal contributor store where the queue *looks* seeded (`bd list` reads both) but the factory finds nothing.

**Check:**

```bash
gc bd list --type=epic   # Letters a–m and Letters n–z
gc bd ready              # twenty-six tasks with no blockers, ids prefixed aa-
```

### 6. Run a task

Pick a letter, and grab its bead id:

```bash
export BEAD_ID=$(gc bd list --type=task --status=open --limit 0 | grep -E "Implement a\.md$" | awk '{print $2}')
gc bd show "$BEAD_ID"
```

Hand it to the factory:

```bash
gc sling ascii-art/factory.planner "$BEAD_ID" --on ascii-art
```

The breakdown of the command is as follows:

- `ascii-art/factory.planner` names the target agent pool as `<rig>/<pack>.<agent>`
- `$BEAD_ID` is the task
- `--on ascii-art` attaches the formula, which is what tells every agent downstream what runs after it

To watch the agents work, you can simply find a session you'd like to watch and attach to it like so:

```bash
gc session list
gc session attach <session-name> # example: gc session attach ascii-art/factory.planner-1
```

**Note: detach with `Ctrl+b` then `d`.** Never `Ctrl+c`. That one kills the session outright, and you may need to restart the agent or city to resume work.

Once the factory is finished, you will see a PR on the other side that you can inspect and merge:

```bash
gh pr view "$(gc bd show "$BEAD_ID" --json | jq -r '.[0].metadata.pr_url')" --web
gh pr merge <number> --merge
```

You should see a new file at `ascii/a.md`, holding an H1 with the letter, a fenced code block with the art in it, and a two-line rhyme. Those constraints aren't arbitrary. They come from [ADR 0001](./adrs/0001.ADR.ASCII.md), which the agents read as part of their context. You can also run another if you like. Same loop, `b.md` instead of `a.md`.
